# Background

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).
# Getting and loading the data
```{r}
library(caret)
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(randomForest)
library(knitr)
```
```{r}
set.seed(12345)

trainUrl <- "http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv"
testUrl <- "http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv"

training <- read.csv(url(trainUrl), na.strings=c("NA","#DIV/0!",""))
testing <- read.csv(url(testUrl), na.strings=c("NA","#DIV/0!",""))
```
Partioning the training set into two
```{r}
inTrain <- createDataPartition(training$classe, p=0.7, list=FALSE)
myTraining <- training[inTrain, ]
myTesting <- training[-inTrain, ]
dim(myTraining); dim(myTesting)
```
# Data cleaning
```{r}
nzv <- nearZeroVar(myTraining, saveMetrics=TRUE)
myTraining <- myTraining[,nzv$nzv==FALSE]

nzv<- nearZeroVar(myTesting,saveMetrics=TRUE)
myTesting <- myTesting[,nzv$nzv==FALSE]
```

```{r}
myTraining <- myTraining[c(-1)]
```
Clean variables with more than 60% NA
```{r}
trainingV3 <- myTraining
for(i in 1:length(myTraining)) {
    if( sum( is.na( myTraining[, i] ) ) /nrow(myTraining) >= .7) {
        for(j in 1:length(trainingV3)) {
            if( length( grep(names(myTraining[i]), names(trainingV3)[j]) ) == 1)  {
                trainingV3 <- trainingV3[ , -j]
            }   
        } 
    }
}

myTraining <- trainingV3
rm(trainingV3)
```
Transform the myTesting and testing data sets
```{r}
clean1 <- colnames(myTraining)
clean2 <- colnames(myTraining[, -58])  # remove the classe column
myTesting <- myTesting[clean1]         # allow only variables in myTesting that are also in myTraining
testing <- testing[clean2]             # allow only variables in testing that are also in myTraining

dim(myTesting)
```
```{r}
dim(testing)
```
```{r}
for (i in 1:length(testing) ) {
    for(j in 1:length(myTraining)) {
        if( length( grep(names(myTraining[i]), names(testing)[j]) ) == 1)  {
            class(testing[j]) <- class(myTraining[i])
        }      
    }      
}
testing <- rbind(myTraining[2, -58] , testing)
testing <- testing[-1,]
```
# Prediction Algorithms
### Prediction with Decision Trees
```{r}
set.seed(12345)
modFitA1 <- rpart(classe ~ ., data=myTraining, method="class")
rpart.plot(modFitA1)
```
```{r}
predictionsA1 <- predict(modFitA1, myTesting, type = "class")
cmtree <- confusionMatrix(predictionsA1, myTesting$classe)
cmtree
```
```{r}
plot(cmtree$table, col = cmtree$byClass, main = paste("Decision Tree Confusion Matrix: Accuracy =", round(cmtree$overall['Accuracy'], 4)))
```
```{r}
set.seed(12345)
modFitB1 <- randomForest(classe ~ ., data=myTraining)
predictionB1 <- predict(modFitB1, myTesting, type = "class")
cmrf <- confusionMatrix(predictionB1, myTesting$classe)
cmrf
```
```{r}
plot(modFitB1)
```
```{r}
plot(cmrf$table, col = cmtree$byClass, main = paste("Random Forest Confusion Matrix: Accuracy =", round(cmrf$overall['Accuracy'], 4)))
```
### Prediction with Generalized Boosted Regression
```{r}
set.seed(12345)
fitControl <- trainControl(method = "repeatedcv",
                           number = 5,
                           repeats = 1)

gbmFit1 <- train(classe ~ ., data=myTraining, method = "gbm",
                 trControl = fitControl,
                 verbose = FALSE)


gbmFinMod1 <- gbmFit1$finalModel

gbmPredTest <- predict(gbmFit1, newdata=myTesting)
gbmAccuracyTest <- confusionMatrix(gbmPredTest, myTesting$classe)
gbmAccuracyTest
```
```{r}
plot(gbmFit1, ylim=c(0.9, 1))
```
# Predicting Results on the Test Data
Random Forests gave an Accuracy in the myTesting dataset of 99.89%, which was more accurate that what I got from the Decision Trees or GBM. The expected out-of-sample error is 100-99.89 = 0.11%.
```{r}
predictionB2 <- predict(modFitB1, testing, type = "class")
predictionB2
```
